# Binaries
MattMckenzy: I've forked this repository to host FreeFileSync and RealTimeSync 11.4 binaries I've managed to compile for aarch64, using GTK 3.0, G++ 10.0 and OpenSSL 3. They work great for me, but no guarantees are made, use at your own risk.

The binaries are location in FreeFileSync.7z.
